"""
Publish a Wagtail page and watch its search-index update run through django-ox.

Wagtail enqueues index updates with ``django_tasks.task`` on every save of an
indexed model, and nothing in the pytest suite drives a real Wagtail project
through that path. This script does, end to end, against a fresh
``wagtail start`` project on SQLite:

1. publish a page whose title carries a unique word, with no task rows before;
2. require queued work and no search hit for the word, because the index
   update has not run yet;
3. start ``manage.py ox_worker --interval 0.2``;
4. poll until no task is READY, RUNNING or WAITING;
5. SIGTERM the worker and require exit 0;
6. require every task SUCCESSFUL and exactly one search hit.

Run it from an environment that has django-ox, Django, Wagtail and
django-tasks installed:

    python tools/wagtail_smoke.py

It exits 0 on success and 1 on failure. Every wait is bounded here rather than
by a shell ``timeout``, so it runs the same way on Linux and macOS. It lives
outside ``tests/`` so pytest never collects it.
